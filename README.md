# ShoppingDatabase

This is the driver program of the business program, which includes the main() method and creates objects of
other classes. It displays the catalogue of a business, which in turn displays menu options to the user.
The classes used display the menu options to the user, and allows them to add, edit, and remove
different inventory members from the organization. It finally outputs all of the staff within the organization.
